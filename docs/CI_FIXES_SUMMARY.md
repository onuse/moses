# CI Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed all GitHub Actions CI pipeline failures across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. GitHub Actions Version Updates
- Updated all deprecated v3 actions to latest versions (v4/v5)
- `actions/checkout@v3` → `v5`
- `actions/cache@v3` → `v4`
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `v4`
- `actions/setup-node@v3` → `v4.4.0`
- `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain@v1` → `v1.13.0`

### 2. Dependency Security Updates
- Fixed critical esbuild vulnerability (CVE) by updating vite
- Updated package.json dependencies
- Added npm install step for root dependencies in CI

### 3. Rust Warnings Fixed (Treated as Errors in CI)
All clippy warnings resolved:
- Fixed doc comment formatting (converted `///` to `//!` for module docs)
- Removed unnecessary borrows in `.args()` calls
- Fixed collapsible if statements
- Added Default implementations where needed
- Fixed redundant closures
- Changed `map_err` to `inspect_err` where appropriate
- Fixed iterator flattening issues
- Removed unnecessary type casts

### 4. Platform-Specific Compilation
- Created macOS platform module with conditional compilation
- Fixed missing Ext4Formatter on non-Linux platforms
- Added platform-specific test configurations
- Ensured all code compiles on all platforms (not just the current one)

### 5. Tauri Configuration
- Changed bundle identifier from default to unique value
- Fixed tauri command not found by using `npx tauri`
- Configured proper build scripts in package.json

## Verification Status
✅ All Rust code compiles without warnings
✅ Clippy passes with `-D warnings`
✅ All unit tests pass
✅ All integration tests pass
✅ Ready for GitHub Actions CI pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Monitor CI pipeline execution
3. All jobs should now pass successfully
