- Machine learning for bad sector prediction

## üìù Notes for Next Session

### Recent Accomplishments (2025-08-20)
1. **FAT32 Implementation Complete**: Native FAT32 formatter without external tools
2. **Modular FAT Architecture**: Created shared FAT components with ~40% code reuse
3. **Socket-Based Worker**: Unified all UAC operations through persistent worker
4. **Fixed Device Access**: Resolved physical drive vs volume path issues

### Architecture Improvements Made
- **Socket-Based Worker System**: Single UAC prompt per session using TCP localhost
- **FAT Module Structure**: 
  - `fat_common/` - Shared components (constants, boot sector, cluster calc, FAT writer)
  - `fat16/` and `fat32/` - Specific implementations
  - Comprehensive validation framework for both
- **Critical Windows Fixes**:
  - Always use physical drive paths for formatting
  - Keep file handles open throughout operations
  - Dismount volumes before formatting

When continuing development:
1. **UI Enhancements**: Add MBR/GPT conversion UI, conflict warnings, 'Prepare Disk' wizard
2. **NTFS Reader**: Implement NTFS filesystem reader
3. **Progress System**: Add real-time progress callbacks and indicators
4. **Build command**: `cargo build --release` in src-tauri directory
5. **Test FAT32**: Format USB drives through Moses UI and verify Windows recognition

### Key Files to Review
- `formatters/src/fat32/formatter_native.rs` - Native FAT32 implementation
- `formatters/src/fat_common/` - Shared FAT components
- `formatters/src/utils.rs` - Device access utilities
- `src-tauri/src/commands/disk_management_socket.rs` - Socket-based worker commands
- `src-tauri/src/bin/moses-elevated-worker.rs` - Elevated worker process
- `platform/src/windows/device.rs` - Device enumeration
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - GUI backend integration

### Development Environment Notes
- Working in WSL on Windows machine
- Main test device: Kingston DataTraveler 3.0 (57.66 GB, PHYSICALDRIVE2)
- WSL2 with Ubuntu installed
- Can't use sudo in WSL without password
